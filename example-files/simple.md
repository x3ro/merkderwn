Operating Systems such as Contiki <!--\cite{Dunkels2004,Contiki}-->, TinyOS <!--\cite{Levis2004,TinyOS}--> and RIOT <!--\cite{bhgws-rotoi-13,RIOTweb}--> are designed to operate in the challenging environment of interconnected embedded devices, differing <!--\foobar--> mainly in kernel architecture and the programming models that are employed for application development <!--\foo[bar]{baz}-->.

<!--\autoref{fig:networkstack}--> illustrates how Watr.li's network stack accomplishes this.

<!--\caption{Employed network stack on both Plant Node (left) and Display Node (right). The center arrow shows the flow of a \gls{CoAP} packet from the \gls{PN} to the \gls{DN} whereas the right arrow shows the
flow of a HTTP/WebSocket packet from the \gls{DN} towards the Internet.}-->

* The **DELETE method** requests that the resource identified by the request <!--\gls{URI}--> be deleted <!--\cite{RFC-7252}-->.

Important papers must also have important inline math, e.g. $5 \times 5$ or even $x = \frac{1}{2}$. Escaping \$-signs should also work.
