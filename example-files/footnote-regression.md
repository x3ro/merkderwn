[^accelerometer-dataflow]: The employed accelerometer (ST LIS3L02AL) has a resolution of $0.5mg$ over a scale of $\pm2g$, yielding 8,000 possible values (13 bits) per axis or 39 bits for all three axes (40 bits when byte-aligned). A single sensor reading thus amounts to 5 bytes of data, the entire sensing period with a frequency of 200Hz over 30s to 30KB.
